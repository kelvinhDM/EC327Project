In the individual folders there is a README for the front and back end. 

Asteroid Reimagined is a modern take on an old game that will implement interactive learning methods within a fun game. We drew inspiration from our own childhoods and the games we played that were both educational yet fun. The basis of our game is the classic arcade game, Asteroid, with a pivot toward education with a focus on astronomy and astrophysics. 

The back end is created with Python and various libraries to build the infrastructure for a database for things like astronomy facts, scores, and etc. 
Front end of the game is created using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).

Each time the player dies a fact is displayed sourced from NASA's API, and the fact is updated each time the local machine's clock reaches 7:00 AM.
